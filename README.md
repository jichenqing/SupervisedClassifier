# SupervisedClassifier

Write a Python supervised learning classifier program individually that uses pandas library to read_csv, uses keras package in tensorflow library to build a neural network model with different activation functions for different layers. Then compile the model with optimizer, loss and metric, and train the model with certain number of epochs, the explanatory variable and response variable. Finally, evaluate the model. If the model is considered accurate, use it to predict the training dataset and use numpy to build the arrays and use matplotlib to plot the arrays.
